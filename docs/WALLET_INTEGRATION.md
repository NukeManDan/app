# Wallet integration guide.

This document is aimed for embedded wallet provider who plans to be integrated into Kickback.

There are already examples PR made by other wallet providers which you can user as references.

- [Universal Login](https://github.com/wearekickback/app/pull/182)
- [Authereum](https://github.com/wearekickback/app/pull/156)

## Requirements

We do expect that your wallet has the following capabilities.

- Simple wallet capability to send/receive ETH/DAI (Otherwise wallet UI need to be built into Kickback)
- Support for test environment (we currently use Kovan)

In addition to these basic features, we welcome any wallet supporting the following capabilities.

- Send/receive NFT (as poap.xyz often airdrop tokens to participants)
- Buy ETH/DAI via Credit/Debit/Apple pay/Google pay (we prefer solutions which works especially in Europe and UK).

## Integration UI flow

### Sign up/Sign in modal

#### When injected web3 provider (Metamask, Opera, Mobile wallet, etc) are detected.

It should give option to use either injected web3 objects or one of the embedded wallet provider objects.

#### When there is no injected web3 provider.

### Authentication

If the wallet is Externally Owned Account, it should work out of the box.
If the wallet is Contract based, then your contract has to have support for  EIP 1271.

For more detail, please read [Integrating a contract based wallet into your Dapp.](https://medium.com/wearekickback/integrating-a-contract-based-wallet-into-your-dapp-1721c1a1148b)

### Wallet Icon

By the time user login using your solution, the wallet of the users are usually empty. Since Kickback does not have any wallet feature, you have to inject your wallet icon next to user profile name.

By clicking your wallet icon, it should either pop up your wallet modal or redirect to your wallet page.

If your wallet does not have basic wallet capability, it needs to be built.

### Logout Button

By clicking `Logout` it must show Login button.
